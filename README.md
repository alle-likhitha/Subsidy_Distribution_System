# Subsidy_Distribution_System
Farmers submit subsidy applications via a blockchain platform, with each recorded as a secure transaction. Authorities verify eligibility using smart contracts, automatically checking conditions like farm size and crop type. Once approved, funds are transferred directly to the farmer's digital wallet, ensuring a fast, secure process.
